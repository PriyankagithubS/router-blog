                    Cyber Security involves the protection of computer systems, networks, and data
                    from cyber attacks. It encompasses technologies, processes, and practices
                    designed to safeguard against unauthorized access, damage, or disruption of
                    information and services.

                <h2>Key Aspects of Cyber Security</h2>
                <p>
                    Cyber security includes several key aspects, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Network Security</li>
                        <li>Information Security</li>
                        <li>Application Security</li>
                        <li>Endpoint Security</li>
                        <li>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</li>
                        <li>Security Operations</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>Cyber Threats</h2>
                <p>
                    Common cyber threats include malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, data breaches,
                    and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Understanding these threats is crucial for
                    implementing effective cyber security measures.
                </p>
                <h2>Skills Required</h2>
                <p>
                    Cyber security professionals need skills in areas such as risk assessment,
                    incident response, encryption technologies, vulnerability assessment, and
                    compliance with regulations and standards.
                </p>
                <h2>Importance of Cyber Security</h2>
                <p>
                    Cyber security is essential to protect sensitive information, maintain privacy,
                    and ensure the continuity of business operations. It helps organizations mitigate
                    risks and respond effectively to cyber incidents.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    As cyber threats continue to evolve, the need for robust cyber security measures
                    grows. Cyber security professionals play a critical role in safeguarding digital
                    assets and maintaining trust in the digital economy.
